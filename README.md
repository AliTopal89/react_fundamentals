# react_fundamentals
React App from Tyler McGinnis React Fundamentals Course

you can follow the course materials from [here](https://github.com/tylermcginnis/react-fundamentals)


### FYI
if you have a sublime version below 3106 like mine `build 3103` then you won't be able to get react through package control
 what I did was:

 ```

$ cd /Users/(username)/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages/  
$ git clone https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime
$ mv babel-sublime Babel
 ```
after this step I was able to install the package

 or you can use this [link](https://github.com/babel/babel-sublime/issues/327) to figure out the problem that you might be having.
